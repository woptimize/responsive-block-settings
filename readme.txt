Easily add responsive settings to all WordPress blocks, and customize the mobile menu breakpoint.

== Description ==

**Responsive Block Settings** is a user-friendly, no-code plugin that allows you to enhance your WordPress blocks with responsive controls, ensuring your content is optimized for all screen sizes.

=== Key Features:===

- **Visibility Control**: Hide or show any block based on the screen sizeâ€”mobile (less than 768px), tablet (768px to 1024px), or desktop (greater than 1024px).
- **Flexible Layout Management**: Stack, reverse, or customize the order of inner blocks within core group blocks using flex layouts and core columns. Ideal for managing complex designs and ensuring optimal content flow across devices.
- **Custom Mobile Menu Breakpoint**: Adjust the mobile menu breakpoint for the core navigation block to better align with your site's design.

This plugin provides a simple, intuitive interface, making it accessible for users of all skill levels. It's perfect for anyone looking to fine-tune their site's responsiveness without touching a single line of code.

=== Usage ===

**For All Blocks:**

- Toggle "Hide on Desktop", "Hide on Tablet", and "Hide on Mobile" options to control visibility across devices.
- Enable "Keep visible in the Editor" to maintain block visibility during editing, even when hidden at certain resolutions. Blocks will appear with a dashed border and grayed-out, preserving layout awareness.

**For Stack Groups, Row Groups, and Columns:**

- Toggle "Reverse order on Tablet" and "Reverse order on Mobile" to alter the sequence of inner blocks on respective devices and reverse the order.


**For Row Groups:**

- Toggle "Stack on Tablet" and "Stack on Mobile" to arrange inner blocks vertically on smaller screens.

**For Direct Child Blocks (within Stack Groups, Row Groups, Grid Groups, and Columns):**

- Specify custom values for "Order on Tablet" and "Order on Mobile" to set precise positioning on different devices.

**For Navigation Blocks with Mobile Overlay Menu:**

- Select a custom breakpoint to determine when the navigation collapses into a menu icon, allowing for tailored responsive behavior.
